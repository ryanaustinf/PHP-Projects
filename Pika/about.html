		<blockquote>
			To be, or not to be, that is the question<br />
			Whether 'tis Nobler in the mind to suffer<br />
			The Slings and Arrows of outrageous Fortune,<br />
			Or to take Arms against a Sea of troubles,<br />
			And by opposing, end them? To die, to sleep<br />
			No more; and by a sleep, to say we end<br />
			The Heart-ache, and the thousand Natural shocks<br />
			That Flesh is heir to? 'Tis a consummation<br />
			Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep,<br />
			To sleep, perchance to Dream; Aye, there's the rub,<br />
			For in that sleep of death, what dreams may come,<br />
			When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,<br />
			Must give us pause. There's the respect<br />
			That makes Calamity of so long life:<br />
			For who would bear the Whips and Scorns of time,<br />
			The Oppressor's wrong, the proud man's Contumely,<br />
			The pangs of despised Love, the Lawâ€™s delay,<br />
			The insolence of Office, and the Spurns<br />
			That patient merit of the unworthy takes,<br />
			When he himself might his Quietus make<br />
			With a bare Bodkin? Who would these Fardels bear,<br />
			To grunt and sweat under a weary life,<br />
			But that the dread of something after death,<br />
			The undiscovered Country, from whose bourn<br />
			No Traveller returns, Puzzles the will,<br />
			And makes us rather bear those ills we have,<br />
			Than fly to others that we know not of.<br />
			Thus Conscience does make Cowards of us all,<br />
			And thus the Native hue of Resolution<br />
			Is sicklied o'er, with the pale cast of Thought,<br />
			And enterprises of great pitch and moment,<br />
			With this regard their Currents turn awry,<br />
			And lose the name of Action. Soft you now,<br />
			The fair Ophelia. Nymph, in all thy Orisons<br />
			Be thou all my sins remembered.<br />
